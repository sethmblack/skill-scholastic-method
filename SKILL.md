# Scholastic Method

## Purpose

Provide a systematic approach to intellectual inquiry that structures questions, presents objections honestly, provides authoritative grounding, articulates a reasoned position, and replies to each objection individually. This method promotes intellectual rigor, humility, and thoroughness.


## When to Use

- User explicitly requests this type of analysis or approach
- The situation matches the core use case for this skill
- You need to apply this specific framework or methodology
- The problem requires this particular perspective or lens
- Other approaches have failed and this offers a fresh angle


## When to Invoke

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Help me think through this systematically"
- "What are the arguments on both sides?"
- "I want to really understand this question"
- "Analyze this thoroughly"
- "What would a rigorous treatment look like?"
- "Present the opposing views"
- "Steel-man the objections"

**Contexts:**
- Complex philosophical questions
- Contested theological topics
- Ethical dilemmas with multiple perspectives
- Academic research and writing
- Debate preparation
- Policy analysis
- Any topic requiring balanced, thorough treatment

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Question | The matter to be investigated | Yes |
| Context | Background information | No |

## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```


## Workflow
### The Five-Part Structure of a Scholastic Article

Every question receives treatment in five parts:

```
1. UTRUM (Whether...?) - The question
2. VIDETUR QUOD NON (It seems not...) - Objections
3. SED CONTRA (On the contrary...) - Authority/counter-position
4. RESPONDEO DICENDUM (I answer that...) - The body of the article
5. AD PRIMUM, AD SECUNDUM... (Reply to first, second...) - Replies to objections
```

### Step 1: Formulate the Question (UTRUM)

State the question precisely:
- Use yes/no format when possible ("Whether X is Y")
- Define key terms
- Identify what is at stake
- Narrow scope appropriately

**Example formulations:**
- "Whether it is ever permissible to lie"
- "Whether the soul survives bodily death"
- "Whether democratic governance is superior to monarchy"

### Step 2: Present Objections (VIDETUR QUOD NON)

State the strongest opposing arguments:

**Requirements:**
- Present objections FIRST (before your own view)
- State them HONESTLY (as opponents would state them)
- Make them STRONG (steel-man, not straw-man)
- Give REASONS (not just assertions)

**Format for each objection:**
- "It seems that [contrary position] because [reason]"
- Support with authority, experience, or reasoning

**Number of objections:** Typically 3-5, covering major opposing considerations

**Purpose:** This demonstrates:
- Intellectual humility (you take opposition seriously)
- Thorough understanding (you know the counterarguments)
- Good faith (you are not hiding inconvenient facts)

### Step 3: State the Contrary Position (SED CONTRA)

Before your own argument, cite an authority supporting your position:

**Purpose:**
- Shows you are not innovating arbitrarily
- Grounds position in tradition or expertise
- Provides initial support before detailed argument

**Sources of authority:**
- Scripture (for theological questions)
- Philosophers (Aristotle, Plato, etc.)
- Church Fathers (Augustine, etc.)
- Expert consensus
- Sound reasoning from established premises

**Note:** Authority does not PROVE the position but indicates where the weight of considered opinion lies.

### Step 4: Develop the Response (RESPONDEO DICENDUM)

This is the body of the article - your positive argument:

**Structure:**
1. State your position clearly
2. Provide your main argument(s)
3. Make necessary distinctions
4. Address the heart of the matter
5. Conclude definitively

**Key principles:**
- **Distinguish carefully:** Many disputes arise from ambiguity
- **Define terms precisely:** Clarify what you mean
- **Build from principles:** Connect to foundational truths
- **Use clear reasoning:** Make logic explicit

### Step 5: Reply to Each Objection (AD PRIMUM, AD SECUNDUM...)

Address each objection individually:

**Strategies for replies:**
- **Distinguish:** Show the objection conflates different things ("I grant X, but deny Y")
- **Deny premise:** Show a premise is false
- **Accept conclusion:** Show the objection's conclusion is compatible with your view
- **Limit scope:** Show the objection applies only in certain cases
- **Turn the objection:** Show it actually supports your position

**Never:**
- Ignore an objection
- Dismiss it without reason
- Mock the objector

## Example Application

**User question:** "Is it ever morally permissible to lie to protect an innocent person?"

**Scholastic Treatment:**

---

### ARTICLE: Whether It Is Permissible to Lie to Protect the Innocent

**UTRUM** (Question): Whether lying to protect an innocent person from unjust harm is morally permissible.

---

**VIDETUR QUOD SIC** (Objections - that it IS permissible):

**Objection 1:** It seems that such lying is permissible. For the Hebrew midwives lied to Pharaoh to protect innocent children (Exodus 1:19), and Scripture says "God dealt well with the midwives" (Exodus 1:20). But Scripture would not commend what is intrinsically wrong. Therefore, lying to protect the innocent is permissible.

**Objection 2:** Further, love of neighbor is a higher obligation than truthful speech. But refusing to lie in such circumstances shows lack of love for the innocent victim. Therefore, love requires lying in such cases.

**Objection 3:** Further, the aggressor has no right to the truth that would enable him to harm the innocent. One cannot have duty to provide what another has no right to receive. Therefore, there is no duty to tell the truth to unjust aggressors.

---

**SED CONTRA** (On the contrary):

Augustine says: "A lie is a false signification with intent to deceive. It is never lawful to tell a lie, even to avoid harm to another." And Scripture says: "You shall not bear false witness" (Exodus 20:16), without exception for good intentions.

---

**RESPONDEO DICENDUM** (I answer that):

I answer that lying is intrinsically evil and cannot be made good by circumstances or intention, even the intention to protect the innocent.

A lie is defined as speaking contrary to what one believes to be true, with intent to deceive. It is wrong because:

1. **It violates the natural purpose of speech**, which is to communicate truth. Using speech contrary to its nature is a disorder.

2. **It harms the good of trust** on which human community depends. Even "good" lies erode the general reliability of communication.

3. **It treats the deceived person as means only**, manipulating their rational faculty rather than respecting their capacity for truth.

However, one must distinguish lying from:
- **Mental reservation**: Speaking truth in a limited sense
- **Refusing to answer**: One need not provide information
- **Diversion**: Changing the subject
- **Amphibology**: Statements true in one sense though heard in another

One may use these strategies without lying. One may also accept martyrdom rather than sin.

---

**AD PRIMUM** (Reply to Objection 1):

To the first objection, the midwives were commended for their faith and courage in resisting Pharaoh, not specifically for the method of lying. God blessed them "because they feared God" (Exodus 1:21), not because they lied. Their lie was a venial imperfection accompanying heroic virtue, as even saints may sin in minor matters.

**AD SECUNDUM** (Reply to Objection 2):

To the second objection, love of neighbor does not require sin. One cannot help a neighbor by offending God. True love seeks the other's genuine good, which includes not being made complicit in sin. Moreover, there are other ways to protect the innocent (resistance, diversion, silence) that do not require lying.

**AD TERTIUM** (Reply to Objection 3):

To the third objection, it is true that the aggressor has no right to information useful for evil. But this does not grant permission to lie. One may refuse to answer, resist the questioner, or use mental reservation. The aggressor's lack of right to truth does not create in us a right to lie. Two wrongs do not make a right.
